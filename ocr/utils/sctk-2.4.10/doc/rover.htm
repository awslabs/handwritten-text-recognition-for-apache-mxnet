<UL> 
    -h hypfile ctm
	<UL>
                Define the hypothesis file and it's format. This option
                must be used more than once.  Currently, only the ctm format

<p><B>Output Options </B>
<UL>
    -o outfile
	<UL>  Define the output file.  (Will be same format as hyps)
	</UL>
    -f level
	<UL>    Defines feedback mode, default is 1

    -l width   
	<UL> Defines the line width.

<p><B>Voting Options </B>
<UL>
    -m meth 
	<UL> Set the voting method 'meth' to one of the following:
	<BR>
	<BR>
          oracle   -> output the fully alternated transcript<BR>
          meth1    -> alpha = -a , conf = -c, choose highest avg<BR>

          maxconfa -> 
		<UL>
		Same as maxconf, but set the confidence score for
		the NULL transition arcs to be the number of NULL transition

    -a alpha   <UL> Set Alpha to 'alpha'.  Alpha is the tradeoff between

<p>

Rover is a tool combine hypothesized word outputs of multiple
recognition systems and select the best scoring word sequence. 
Rover is part of the <A HREF="sctk.htm">NIST SCTK</A> Scoring Tookit. A
number of different output formats can be generated and different
scoring functions can be specified.  A more complete description of
the rover system can be found in the paper <A HREF="rover/rover.htm">
A post-processing system to yield reduced word error rates: Recognizer
Output Voting Error Reduction (ROVER).</A> 

<p> The ROVER system is implemented in two modules. First, the system
outputs from two or more ASR systems are combined into a single word
transition network. The network is created using a modification of the
dynamic programming alignment protocol traditionally used by NIST to
evaluate ASR technology. Once the network is generated, the second
module evaluates each branching point using a voting scheme, which
selects the best scoring word (with the highest number of votes) for
the new transcription.  The following figure depicts the the overall
system architecture.

<p>

The heart of the Rover program is the ability to combine system
outputs of mulitple recognition systems using an iterative Dynamic
Programming alignment protocol into a single, composite Word
Transition Network (WTN).  The protocol is fully described in the
<A HREF="rover/rover.htm#Section2.1">
	Section 2.1. RECOGNITION OUTPUT ALIGNMENT MODULE </A> of the paper.

<p>

Once the composite WTN is produced, each correspondence set (CS) is
evaluated using the selected scoring function.  <A
HREF="rover/rover.htm#Section2.2"> Section 2.2. WTN VOTING SEARCH
MODULE:</A> describes the voting process in detail.

There are three voting schemes described in the paper:

<UL>
<A HREF="rover/rover.htm#Section2.2.1"> By Word Frequency </A>
	<UL> To use word frequency as the scoring function, use	the options
	    '-m avgconf -a 1.0 -c 0.0'.  By setting -a to 1.0, the tradeoff
	    between  word occurrences and confidence scores, only the 
	    word occurrences are used.
	</UL>
</UL>
<UL> 
<A HREF="rover/rover.htm#Section2.2.2"> By Average Confidence Scores </A>
	<UL> The '-m avgconf' option make the voting function use
	average confidence scores.
	</UL>
</UL>
<UL>
<A HREF="rover/rover.htm#Section2.2.3"> By Word Maximum Confidence Scores </A>
	<UL> The '-m maxconf' option make the voting function use
	the maximum confidence per word as the scoring metric.
	</UL>
</UL>
