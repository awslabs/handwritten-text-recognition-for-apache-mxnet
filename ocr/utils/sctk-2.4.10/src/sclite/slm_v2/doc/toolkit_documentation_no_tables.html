Introduction
</H2>

<p>Version 1 of the Carnegie Mellon University Statistical Language
Modeling toolkit was written by <a
href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/afs/cs.cmu.edu/user/roni/WWW/HomePage.html">Roni
Rosenfeld</a>, and released in 1994. It is available by ftp from <a
href="ftp://ftp.cs.cmu.edu/project/fgdata/CMU_SLM_Toolkit_V1.0_release.tar.Z">here</a>.
Here is a excerpt from its README file:</p>

<pre>

                Overview of the CMU SLM Toolkit, Rev 1.0
                ========================================

  The Carnegie Mellon Statistical Language Modeling (CMU SLM) Toolkit
is a set of unix software tools designed to facilitate language
modeling work in the research community.

  Some of the tools are used to process general textual data into:
    - word frequency lists and vocabularies
    - word bigram and trigram counts
    - vocabulary-specific word bigram and trigram counts
    - bigram- and trigram-related statistics
    - various Backoff bigram and trigram language models

  Others use the resulted language models to compute:
    - perplexity
    - Out-Of-Vocabulary (OOV) rate
    - bigram- and trigram-hit ratios
    - distribution of Backoff cases
    - annotation of test data with language scores

</pre>

<p>Version 2 of the toolkit seeks to maintain the structure of version
1, to include all (or very nearly all) of the functionality of
version 1, and to provide useful improvements in terms of
functionality and efficiency. The key differences between this version
and version 1 are described in the <a href="#changes">next section</a>.</p>

<hr size=4>

<H2>
<a name="changes">
Changes from Version 1
</H2>

<H3>
Efficient pre-processing tools
</H3>

<p>The tools used to generate vocabulariesm, and to process the <a
href="#text_stream">text stream</a> which is used as training data
into a <a href="#idngram_file">id n-gram file</a> to serve as input to
<a href="#idngram2lm"><tt>idngram2lm</tt></a> have been completely
re-written, in order to increase their efficiency.</p>

<p>All of the tools have been written in C, so there is no longer the
reliance on shell scripts and UNIX tools such as <tt>sort</tt> and
<tt>awk</tt>. The tools now run much faster, due to requiring much less
disk I/O, although they do now require more RAM than the tools of
version 1.</p>

<H3>
Multiple discounting strategies
</H3>

<p>Version 1 of the toolkit allowed only Good-Turing discounting to be
used in the construction of the models. Version 2 allows any of the
following discounting strategies:</p>

<UL>
<LI><a href="#good_turing">Good Turing discounting</a>
<LI><a href="#witten_bell">Witten Bell discounting</a>
<LI><a href="#absolute">Absolute discounting</a>
<LI><a href="#linear">Linear discounting</a>
</UL>

<H3>
Use of n-grams with arbitrary n
</H3>

<p> The tools in the toolkit are no longer limited to the construction
and testing of bigram and trigram language models. As larger corpora,
and faster machines with more memory become available, it is becoming
more interesting to examine 4-grams, 5-grams, etc. The tools in
version 2 of this toolkit enable these models to be constructed and
evaluated.</p> 

<H3>
Interactive language model evaluation
</H3>

<p>The program <a href="#evallm"><tt>evallm</tt></a> is used to test the
language models produced by the toolkit. Commands to this program are
read in from the standard input after the language model has been
read, so the user can issue commands interactively, rather than simply
from the shell command line. This means that if the user wants to
calculate the perplexity of a particular language model with respect
to several different texts, the language model only needs to be read
once.</p>

<H3>
Evaluation of ARPA format language models
</H3>
Version 2 of the toolkit includes the ability to calculate perplexities
of ARPA format language models.

<H3>
Handling of context cues
</H3>

<p>In version 1, the tags <SAMP>&lt;s&gt;</SAMP>, <SAMP>
&lt;p&gt;</SAMP>, and <SAMP>&lt;art&gt;</SAMP> were all hard-wired to
represent <a href="#context_cues_file">context cues</a>, and the tag <SAMP>&lt;s&gt;</SAMP> was
required to be in the vocabulary. In version 2, one may have any
number of context cues (or none at all), and they may be represented
by any symbols one chooses. The context cues are a subset of the
vocabulary, and are specified in a <a
href="#context_cues_file">context cue file</a>.</p>

<p>In order to produce the same behaviour from version 2 as from
version 1, the context cues file should contain the following
lines:</p>

<pre>&lts&gt
&ltp&gt
&ltart&gt</pre>

<H3>
Compact data storage
</H3>

<p>The data structures used to store the n-grams are more compact than
those of version 1, with the result that language models construction
is a less memory intensive task.  For example, for a trigram language
model, version 1 required 12 bytes per bigram and 4 bytes per
trigram. Version 2 requires only 8 bytes per bigram and 4 bytes per
trigram.</p>

<H3>
Support for <tt>gzip</tt> compression 
</H3>
<p>As well as the <tt>compress</tt> <a href="#compression">data
compression</a> utility used in version 1 of the toolkit, there is now
also support for <tt>gzip</tt>.</p>

<H3>
Confidence interval capping
</H3>

Confidence interval capping has been omitted from version 2 of the
toolkit.

<H3>
<a name="forced_backoff">
Forced back-off
</H3>


<a name="forced_back_off_incexc">


The tool used for evaluating language models allows the user to
specify a set of <i>forced back-off</i> parameters.  There may be
items in the vocabulary (especially context cues and the "unknown"
symbol) from which we may want to back-off all the time. For example,
if we see the word string A &lts&gt B (where <tt>&lts&gt</tt>
is a context cue indicating a sentence boundary), then instead of
predicting the probability of <tt>B</tt> based on the full context
(P(B | A &lts&gt)), we may wish to disregard the information before
the sentence boundary. Therefore we might want to back-off to the
bigram distribution P(B | &lts&gt) (<i>inclusive</i> forced back-off)
or even to the unigram distribution P(B) (<i>exclusive</i> forced
back-off).  Version 2 supports both types of forced back-off for
arbitrary vocabulary items.


<p>The <a href="#evallm"><tt>evallm</tt></a> program allows the user to
specify either inclusive or exclusive forced back-off, as well as a
list of words from which to enforce back-off.</p>


<H2>
<a name="installing">
Installing the Toolkit
</H2>

<p>For "big-endian" machines (eg those running HP-UX, IRIX, SunOS,
Solaris) the installation procedure is simply to change into the
<tt>src/</tt> directory and type</p>

<pre>
make install
</pre>

The executables will then be copied into the <tt>bin/</tt> directory, and the
library file <tt>SLM2.a</tt> will be copied into the <tt>lib/</tt> directory.

For "little-endian" machines (eg those running Ultrix, Linux) the
variable <tt>BYTESWAP_FLAG</tt> will need to be set in the Makefile. This can
be done by editing <tt>src/Makefile</tt> directly, so that the line

<pre>
#BYTESWAP_FLAG  = -DSLM_SWAP_BYTES
</pre>

is changed to 

<pre>
BYTESWAP_FLAG  = -DSLM_SWAP_BYTES
</pre>

<p>Then the program can be installed as before.</p>
<p>If you are unsure of the "endian-ness" of your machine, then the shell
script <tt>endian.sh</tt> should be able to provide some assistance.</p>

<p>In case of problems, then more information can be found by examining
<tt>src/Makefile</tt>.</p>

<a name="stdmem">

<p>Before building the executables, it might be worth adjusting the
value of <tt>STD_MEM</tt> in the file <tt>src/toolkit.h</tt>. This
value controls the default amount of memory (in MB) that the programs
will attempt to assign for the large buffers used by some of the
programs (this value can, of course, be overridden at the command
line). The result is that the final process sizes will be a few MB
bigger than this value. The more memory that can be grabbed, the
faster the programs will run. The default value is 100, but if the
machines which the tools will be run on contain less, or much more
memory than this, then this value should be adjusted to reflect
this.</p>

<a name="compression">
<p>These files may all be written are read by all the tools in
compressed or uncompressed mode. Specifically, if a filename is given
a <tt>.Z</tt> extension, then it will be read from the specified file
via a <tt>zcat</tt> pipe, or written via a <tt>compress</tt> pipe. If
a filename is given a <tt>.gz</tt>, it will be read from the specified
file via a <tt>gunzip</tt> pipe, or written via a <tt>gzip</tt> pipe. If
either of these compression schemes are to be used, then the relevant
tools (ie <tt>zcat</tt>, and <tt>compress</tt> or <tt>gzip</tt>) must
be available on the system, and pointed to by the path.</p>

<p>If a filename argument is given as <tt>-</tt> then it is assumed to
represent either the standard input, or standard output (according to
context). Any file read from the standard input is assumed to be
uncompressed, and therefore, all desired compression and decompression
should take place in a pipe: <tt>zcat &lt abc.Z | abc2xyz | compress &gt
xyz.Z</tt></p>

<p><strong>Input</strong> : <a href="#text_stream">Text stream</a> </p>

<p><strong>Output</strong> : List of every word which occurred in the text,
along with its number of occurrences.</o>

<p><strong>Notes</strong> : Uses a hash-table to provide an efficient method of
counting word occurrences. Output list is not sorted (due to
"randomness" of the hash-table), but can be easily sorted into the
user's desired order by the UNIX <tt>sort</tt> command. In any case, the output does not need to be sorted in order to serve as input for <a href="#wfreq2vocab"><tt>wfreq2vocab</tt></a>.</p>

<p><strong>Command Line Syntax:</strong></p>

            [ -verbosity 2]
            < .wfreq > .vocab
</pre>

<p> The <tt>-top</tt> parameter allows the user to specify the size of
the vocabulary; if the program is called with the command <tt>-top 20000</tt>,
then the vocabulary will consist of the most common 20,000 words.</p>

<p> The <tt>-gt</tt> parameter allows the user to specify the number
of times that a word must occur to be included in the vocabulary; if
the program is called with the command <tt>-gt 10</tt>, then the
vocabulary will consist of all the words which occurred more than 10
times.</p>

<p>If neither the <tt>-gt</tt>, nor the <tt>-top</tt> parameters are
specified, then the program runs with the default setting of taking the
top 20,000 words.</p>

<p>The <tt>-records</tt> parameter allows the user to specify how many
of the word and count records to allocate memory for. If the number of
words in the input exceeds this number, then the program will fail, but
a high number will obviously result in a higher memory requirement.</p>

<p>The size of the buffer which is used to store the n-grams can be
specified using the <tt>-buffer</tt> parameter. This value is in
megabytes, and the default value can be changed from 100 by changing
the value of <tt>STD_MEM</tt> in the file
<tt>src/toolkit.h</tt> before compiling the

<p>The program will also report the frequency of frequency of n-grams,
and the corresponding recommended value for the <tt>-spec_num</tt> parameters
of <a href="#idngram2lm"><tt>idngram2lm</tt></a>. The

<p>In the case of really huge quantities of data, it may be the case
that more temporary files are generated than can be opened at one time
by the filing system. In this case, the temporary files will be merged
in chunks, and the <tt>-files</tt> parameter can be used to specify
how many files are allowed to be open at one time.</p>

<p> The <tt>-context</tt> parameter allows the user to specify a file
containing a list of words within the vocabulary which will serve as
context cues (for example, markers which indicate the beginnings of
sentences and paragraphs).</p>

<p> <tt> -calc_mem, -buffer</tt> and <tt>-spec_num x y ... z</tt> are
options to dictate how it is decided how much memory should be
allocated for the n-gram counts data structure. <tt>-calc_mem</tt>
demands that the id n-gram file should be read twice, so that we can
accurately calculate the amount of memory required. <tt>-buffer</tt>
allows the user to specify an amount of memory to grab, and divides
this memory equally between the 2,3, ..., n-gram
tables. <tt>-spec_num</tt> allows the user to specify exactly how many
2-grams, 3-grams, ... , and n-grams will need to be stored. The
default is <tt>-buffer <a href="#stdmem">STD_MEM</a></tt>.</p>

<p>The toolkit provides for three types of vocabulary, which each handle
out-of-vocabulary (OOV) words in different ways, and which are
specified using the <tt>-vocab_type</tt> flag.</p>

<p>A <i>closed vocabulary</i> (<tt>-vocab_type 0</tt>) model does not
make any provision for OOVs. Any such words which appear in either the
training or test data will cause an error. This type of model might be
used in a command/control environment where the vocabulary is
restricted to the number of commands that the system understands, and
we can therefore guarantee that no OOVs will occur in the training or
test data. </p>

<p>An <i>open vocabulary</i> model allows for OOVs to occur; out of
vocabulary words are all mapped to the same symbol. Two types of open
vocabulary model are implemented in the toolkit. The first type
(<tt>-vocab_type 1</tt>) treats this symbol the same way as any other
word in the vocabulary. The second type (<tt>-vocab_type 2</tt>) of
open vocabulary model is to cover situations where no OOVs occurred in
the training data, but we wish to allow for the situation where they
could occur in the test data. This situation could occur, for example,
if we have a limited amount of training data, and we choose a
vocabulary which provides 100% coverage of the training set. In this
case, an arbitrary proportion of the discount probability mass
(specified by the <tt>-oov_fraction</tt> option) is reserved for OOV
words.</p>


<p> The <a href="#discounting_strategies">discounting strategy</a> and
its parameters are specified by the <tt>-linear</tt>,
<tt>-absolute</tt>, <tt>-good_turing</tt> and <tt>-witten_bell</tt>
options. With Good Turing discounting, one can also specify the range
over which discounting occurs, using the <tt>-disc_ranges</tt>
option.</p>

<p> The user can specify the cutoffs for the 2-grams, 3-grams, ...,
n-grams by using the <tt>-cutoffs</tt> parameter. A cutoff of <i>K</i> means
that > n-grams occurring <i>K</i> or fewer times are discarded. If the
parameter is omitted, then all the cutoffs are set to zero. </p>

The <tt>-zeroton_fraction</tt> option specifies that P(zeroton) (the unigram
probability assigned to a vocabulary word that did not occurred at all
in the training data) will be at least that fraction of P(singleton) (the
probability assigned to a vocabulary word that occurred exactly once
in the training data).

<p>By default, the n-gram counts are stored in two bytes by use of a
count table (this allows the counts to exceed 65535, while keeping the
data structures used to store the model compact). However, if more
than 65535 <strong>distinct</strong> counts need to be stored (very
unlikely, unless constructing 4-gram or higher language models using
Good-Turing discounting), the -four_byte_counts option will need to be
used.</p>

<p> The floating point values of the back-off weights may
be stored as two-byte integers, by using the <tt>-two_byte_alphas</tt>
switch. This will introduce slight rounding errors, and so should only
be used if memory is short. The <tt>-min_alpha</tt>,
<tt>-max_alpha</tt> and <tt>-out_of_range_alphas</tt> are parameters
used by the functions for using two-byte alphas. Their values should
only be altered if the program instructs it. For further details, see
the comments in the source file <tt>src/two_byte_alphas.c</tt>.

<p><strong>Notes:</strong> <tt>evallm</tt> can receive and process commands
interactively. When it is run, it loads the language model specified
at the command line, and waits for instructions from the user. The
user may specify one of the following commands: </p>

<UL>
<LI> <strong><tt>perplexity</tt></strong><br>
Computes the perplexity of a given text. May optionally specify words
from which to <a href="#forced_backoff">force back-off</a>.<br><br>

         [ -backoff_from_list .fblist ]
         [ -include_unks ] </pre> 

If the <tt>-probs</tt> parameter is specified, then each individual
word probability will be written out to the specified <a
href="#prob_stream">probability stream</a> file.<br> If the
<tt>-oovs</tt> parameter is specified, then any out-of-vocabulary
(OOV) words which are encountered in the test set will be written out
to the specified file. <br>

If the <tt>-annotate</tt> parameter is used, then an annotation file
will be created, containing information on the probability of each
word in the test set according to the language model, as well as the
back-off class for each event. The back-off classes can be interpreted
as follows: Assume we have a trigram language model, and are trying to
predict P(C | A B). Then back-off class "3" means that the trigram "A
B C" is contained in the model, and the probability was predicted
based on that trigram. "3-2" and "3x2" mean that the model backed-off
and predicted the probability based on the bigram "B C"; "3-2" means
that the context "A B" was found (so a back-off weight was applied),
"3x2" means that the context "A B" was not found.<br>


To <a
href="#forced_backoff">force back-off</a> from all unknown words, use
the <tt>-backoff_from_unk_inc</tt> or <tt>-backoff_from_unk_exc</tt>
flag (the difference being the difference between <a href="#forced_back_off_incexc">inclusive or
exclusive forced back-off</a>). To force back-off from all context-cues, use the
<tt>-backoff_from_ccs_inc</tt> or <tt>-backoff_from_ccs_inc</tt> flag.
One can also specify a list of words from which to back-off, by
storing this list in a <a href="#forced_backoff_file">forced back-off
list file</a> and using the <tt>-backoff_from_list</tt> switch.  <br>

<tt>-include_unks</tt> results in a perplexity

href="#prob_stream">probability streams</a>, as generated by the
<tt>-probs</tt> option of the <tt>perplexity</tt> command of <a
href="#evallm"><tt>evallm</tt></a>. Alternatively these probabilities
could be generated from a seperate piece of code, which assigns word
probabilities according to some other language model, for example a
cache-based LM. This probability stream can then be linearly
interpolated with one from a standard n-gram model using this
tool.</p>

<p> <strong>Output</strong> : An optimal set of interpolation weights
for these probability streams, and (optionally) a probability stream
corresponding to the linear combination of all the input streams,
according to the optimal weights. The optimal weights are calculated
using the expectation maximisation (EM) algorithm.</p>

<p> <strong>Command Line Syntax</strong> :

<pre>interpolate +[-] model1.fprobs +[-] model2.fprobs ... 
        [ -test_all | -test_first n | -test_last n | -cv ]

        [ -stop_ratio 0.999 ]
        [ -probs .fprobs ]
        [ -max_probs 6000000 ]</pre>


<p> The probability stream filenames are prefaced with a <tt>+</tt> (or a
<tt>+-</tt> to indicate that the weighting of that model should be
fixed).</p>


<p> There are a range of options to determine which part of the data
is used to calculate the weights, and which is used to test them. One
can test the perplexity of the interpolated model based on all the
data, using the <tt>-test_all</tt> option, in which case a set of
lambdas must also be specified with the <tt>-lambda</tt> option (ie
the lambdas are pre-specified, and not calculated by the program). One
can specify that the first or last n items are the test set by use of
the <tt>-test_first n</tt> or <tt>-test_last n</tt> options. Or one
can perform two-way cross validation using the <tt>-cv</tt> option. If
none of these are specified then the whole of the data is used for
weight estimation.</p>

<p> By default, the initial interpolation weights are fixed as
1/number_of_models, but alternative values can be stored in a file and
used via the <tt>-in_lambdas</tt> option.</p>

<p> The <tt>-probs</tt> switch allows the user to specify a filename
in which to store the combined probability stream. The optimal lambdas
can also be stored in a file by use of the <tt>-out_lambdas</tt>
command.</p>

<p>The program stops when the ratio of the test-set perplexity between
two successive iterations is above the value specified in the
<tt>-stop_ratio</tt> option.</p>

<p> The data can be partitioned into different classes (with
optimisation being performed seperately on each class) using the
<tt>-tags</tt> parameter. The tags file will contain an integer for
each item in the probability streams corresponding to the class that
the item belongs to. A file specified using the <tt>-captions</tt>
option will allow the user to attach names to each of the
classes. There should be one line in the captions file for each tag,
with each line corresponding to the name of the tag.</p>

<p> The amount of memory allocated to store the probability streams is
dictated by the <tt>-max_probs</tt> option, which indicates the
maximum number of probabilities allowed in one stream. </p>

Discounting Strategies
</H2>

<p>Discounting is the process of replacing the original counts with
modified counts so as to redistribute the probability mass from the
more commonly observed events to the less frequent and unseen
events. If the actual number of occurrences of an event <i>E</i> (such
as a bigram or trigram occurrence) is <i>c</i>(<i>E</i>), then the
modified count is <i>d</i>(<i>c</i>(<i>E</i>))<i>c</i>(<i>E</i>),
where <i>d</i>(<i>c</i>(<i>E</i>)) is known as the discount ratio.</p>

<H3>
<a name="good_turing">
Good Turing discounting
</H3>

<p>Good Turing discounting defines <i>d</i>(<i>r</i>) =
(<i>r</i>+1)<i>n</i>(<i>r</i>+1) / <i>rn</i>(<i>r</i>) where
<i>n</i>(<i>r</i>) is the number of events which occur <i>r</i> times.</p>

<p>The discounting is only applied to counts which occur fewer than
<i>K</i> times, where typically <i>K</i> is chosen to be around
7. This is the "discounting range" which is specified using the
<tt>-disc_ranges</tt> parameter of the <a
href="#idngram2lm"><tt>idngram2lm</tt></a> program.</p>


<p>For further details see "<i>Estimation of Probabilities from Sparse Data
for the Language Model Component of a Speech Recognizer</i>", <strong>Slava
M. Katz</strong>, in "IEEE Transactions on Acoustics, Speech and Signal
Processing", volume ASSP-35, pages 400-401, March 1987.</p>


<H3>
<a name="witten_bell">
Witten Bell discounting
</H3>

<p>The discounting scheme which we refer to here as "Witten Bell
discounting" is that which is referred to as type C in "<i>The
Zero-Frequency Problem: Estimating the Probabilities of Novel Events
in Adaptive Text Compression</i>", <strong>Ian H. Witten and Timothy
C. Bell</strong>, in "IEEE Transactions on Information Theory, Vol 37,
No. 4, July 1991".</p>

<p>The discounting ratio is not dependent on the event's count,
but on <i>t</i>, the number of types which followed the
particular context. It defines <i>d</i>(<i>r,t</i>) =
<i>n</i>/(<i>n</i> + <i>t</i>), where <i>n</i> is the size of the
training set in words. This is equivalent to setting P(<i>w</i> |
<i>h</i>) = <i>c</i> / (<i>n</i> + <i>t</i>) (where <i>w</i> is a
word, <i>h</i> is the history and <i>c</i> is the number of
occurrences of <i>w</i> in the context <i>h</i>), for events that have
been seen, and P(<i>w</i> | <i>h</i>) = <i>t</i> / (<i>n</i> +
<i>t</i>) for unseen events.</p>

<H3>
<a name="absolute">
Absolute discounting
</H3>

<p>Absolute discounting defines <i>d</i>(<i>r</i>) =
(<i>r</i>-<i>b</i>)/<i>r</i>. Typically
<i>b</i>=<i>n</i>(1)/(<i>n</i>(1)+2<i>n</i>(2)). The discounting is
applied to all counts.</p>

<p>This is, of course, equivalent to simply subtracting the constant
<i>b</i> from each count.</p>

<H3>
<a name="linear">
Linear discounting
</H3>

<p>Linear discounting defines <i>d</i>(<i>r</i>) = 1 -
(<i>n</i>(1)/<i>C</i>), where <i>C</i> is the total number of
events. The discounting is applied to all counts.</p>

<p>For further details of both linear and absolute discounting, see
"<i>On structuring probabilistic dependencies in stochastic language
modeling</i>", <strong>H. Ney, U. Essen and R. Kneser</strong> in "Computer
Speech and Language", volume 8(1), pages 1-28, 1994.
